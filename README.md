# Project Rock Exchange - Brilliant Jade

## Introduction
Hey There, so this should be a simpler version to work in and experiment with.
We're using NGINX as the webserver for files, and Docker as the Virtual Machine.
Webpack is used to bundle the CSS files (and later JS files) into one file.

## Getting Started
Run Docker Compose in one terminal.
Run Npm install and npm run watch in another.
```
docker-compose up -d
npm install
npm run watch
```

Then go to localhost and your index.html file should appear!
It's already got the CSS and JS files needed.
So good luck and have fun!
